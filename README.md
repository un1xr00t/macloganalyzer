# macOS Crash Log Analyzer

A Python-based tool to parse and analyze macOS crash logs. This project extracts key information from crash log files—such as the process name, exception type, backtrace, and more—and provides a basic diagnosis of potential causes. It serves as a starting point for developers and support engineers to quickly understand and debug crashes based on log data.

## Features

- **Crash Log Parsing:**  
  Extracts essential fields from typical macOS crash logs, including:
  - Process name
  - Identifier
  - Version
  - Exception Type & Exception Codes
  - Crashed Thread
  - A summary of the backtrace

- **Basic Diagnosis:**  
  Provides a rudimentary analysis based on common exception types (e.g., `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`, `SIGABRT`, `EXC_CRASH`) to help pinpoint potential causes of the crash.

- **Command-Line Interface:**  
  Analyze crash logs easily via the terminal by specifying the path to the log file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**  
  Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **Basic Command-Line Knowledge**  
  Familiarity with terminal operations is useful for running the tool.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/macos-crash-log-analyzer.git`
   `cd macos-crash-log-analyzer`
2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
  `python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage
Run the analyzer by providing the path to your macOS crash log file:

`python crash_log_analyzer.py /path/to/your/crash_log.log`

The script will output a summary that includes:

  Key information extracted from the crash log (e.g., process, identifier, exception type)
  A simple diagnosis based on the exception type
  A brief backtrace summary for additional context

## Future Enhancements

  Enhanced Parsing:
  Improve support for various crash log formats and capture additional details such as complete stack traces, loaded modules, and environment information.

  Automated Symbolication:
  Integrate with symbolication services to translate memory addresses into human-readable function names.

  Advanced Diagnosis:
  Incorporate more sophisticated heuristics or machine learning models to better pinpoint the root causes of crashes.

  Graphical Interface:
  Develop a GUI for easier navigation and analysis of crash logs.
