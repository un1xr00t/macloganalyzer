# macloganalyzer
A Python-based tool to parse and analyze macOS crash logs. This project extracts key information from crash log files (e.g., process name, exception type, backtrace) and provides a basic diagnosis of potential causes. It serves as a starting point for developers and support engineers to quickly understand and debug crashes based on log data.
