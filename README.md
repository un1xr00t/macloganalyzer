# macOS Crash Log Analyzer

A Python-based tool to parse and analyze macOS crash logs. This tool extracts key information from crash log files—such as process details, OS version, exception type, termination reason, and backtrace—and provides an improved diagnosis of potential causes. It is designed to help developers and support engineers quickly understand and debug crashes based on log data.

## Features

- **Enhanced Crash Log Parsing:**  
  The analyzer now extracts additional fields commonly found in macOS crash reports, including:
  - **Process:** Name of the crashed process.
  - **Identifier:** Bundle identifier of the process.
  - **Version:** Application version.
  - **OS Version:** The version of macOS running on the system.
  - **Exception Type & Exception Codes:** Details of the exception.
  - **Termination Reason:** Additional details about why the process terminated.
  - **Crashed Thread:** The thread number that caused the crash.
  - **Backtrace:** A summary of the backtrace for further analysis.

- **Improved Diagnosis:**  
  Provides more descriptive diagnostics based on:
  - Exception types (e.g., `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`, `SIGABRT`, `EXC_CRASH`, `EXC_ARITHMETIC`)
  - Termination reasons and other hints found in macOS crash reports

- **Command-Line Interface:**  
  Easily analyze crash logs via the terminal by providing the path to the log file.

- **Inspired by Industry Insights:**  
  Enhanced using insights from articles like [How to Understand macOS Finder Crash Report Alerts](https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-understand-macos-finder-crash-report-alerts).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+**  
  Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

- **Basic Command-Line Knowledge**  
  Familiarity with terminal operations is useful for running the tool.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/un1xr00t/macloganalyzer.git
   cd macloganalyzer
   
2. **(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

  `python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate`
  
3. **Install Dependencies:**

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
## Usage
Run the analyzer by providing the path to your macOS crash log file:

`python3 crash_log_analyzer.py /path/to/your/crash_log.log`

The script will output a summary that includes:

  Key information extracted from the crash log (e.g., process, identifier, exception type)
  A simple diagnosis based on the exception type
  A brief backtrace summary for additional context

## Future Enhancements

  Enhanced Parsing:
  Improve support for various crash log formats and capture additional details such as complete stack traces, loaded modules, and environment information.

  Automated Symbolication:
  Integrate with symbolication services to translate memory addresses into human-readable function names.

  Advanced Diagnosis:
  Incorporate more sophisticated heuristics or machine learning models to better pinpoint the root causes of crashes.

  Graphical Interface:
  Develop a GUI for easier navigation and analysis of crash logs.
